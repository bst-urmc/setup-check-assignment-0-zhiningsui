# Introduction

This is a demonstration file to go in lecture 01. I will run through it in front of the class.

# Housekeeping

```{marginfigure}
Your email address is the address tied to your GitHub account and your name should be first and last name.
```

Before we can get started we need to take care of some required housekeeping.
These should only need to be done once, or maybe once a month for the PAT.

Specifically,  we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your email address and your name.

- Install GIT, R, Rstudio (see the Resources on the homepage for links).

- Open RStudio and go to the **Console** for these one-off bits.
Run these lines in interactive mode (you can copy-and-paste them but you'll have to make them specific to yourself).
```
  library(usethis, gitcreds)

  #if that doesn't work, install the packages and try the previous    line again.
  install.packages("usethis")  #These should only be needed once
  install.packages("gitcreds") 
  
  ```

-  Let git know about your github username and email by editing this as appropriate and entering it into the Console:

  I put 
  ```
  usethis::use_git_config(
  scope = "user",
  user.name = "Tanzy Love",
  user.email = "Tanzy_Love@urmc.rochester.edu")
  ```

-  Next, we need to set up a personal access token so that you can write from rstudio cloud to github. To do this, enter use the following command into the Console:
   ```
   usethis::create_github_token()
   ```
Follow the instructions.  **Be sure to save the PAT in a password manager**, you will have to re-enter it, depending on your set-up.

   ```
   gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
   ```
paste in the token from the last step.  If you picked this token to have a 6 month expiration, you shouldn't have to do this again.

# Getting started

Each of your assignments will begin with the following steps. You can always refer back to this lab (or other labs) for a detailed list of the steps involved for getting started with an assignment.

This part you will do every time you have an assignment or lab.

FIGURES REMOVED and directories adjusted.

- Click on the assignment link that you should have received in your email to create your GitHub repository (which we'll refer to as "repo" going forward) for the assignment. This repo contains a template you can build on to complete your assignment.

- Note that it's not in *your* GitHub folder, it's in the coursespace (so I can see it but you can't see each other's) and it is a copy of the template that I made to be here.

- On GitHub, click on the green **Clone or download** button, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with HTTPS** as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL. It will start with the class "bst-urmc" and end with your username "tanzylove" (for me) and the middle is based on what the assignment is named.

- Go to RStudio clone the assignment repository. This is the one copy and paste into RStudio part that you will do each time you start to work. 
```
###  #'s comment out lines in R code

#you need to change this to the right repository and location for you and your local machine
usethis::create_from_github("https://github.com/bst-urmc/setup-check-assignment-0-tanzylove",
   destdir="~/Documents/work/teaching/BST430/")

```

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the function
- If you need to login to github, a login box should pop up.
- It opens up a new copy of RStudio with all the files from the repository in question.



# Data

Now, for the statistics!!!

Read in some data.

```{r hotdogs}
hotdogs=read.table("Hdcalsod.TXT", header=T)

colnames(hotdogs)
hotdogs$Calories

attach(hotdogs)

plot(Calories, Sodium, xlab="Calories", ylab="Sodium", pch=16)
cor(Calories, Sodium)

plot(Calories, Sodium, xlab="Calories", ylab="Sodium", 
	col=factor(Type), pch=16)
legend("bottomright", levels(factor(Type)), col=1:3, pch=1)
```

Let's try a different data set. This one about 50 states.

```{r raingrad}
hsgrads=read.table("raingrad.TXT", header=T, sep="\t")
attach(hsgrads)

plot(Rain, Education, 
      xlab="Rainfall", ylab="Average Grade Level", pch=16)
cor(Rain, Education)

args(cor)
```

And one final set of flying times.

```{r delta}
delta=read.table("Deltafly.TXT", header=T)
attach(delta)

hist(Miles, xlab="Distance (Miles)")
hist(DepHr, main=NULL, xlab="Departure Hour (24hour)", xlim=c(0,24))
hist(TravTime, main=NULL, xlab="Travel Time (Hours)")

plot(Miles, TravTime, xlab="Distance (Miles)", ylab="Travel Time (Hours)")
cor(Miles, TravTime)

reg.line=lm(TravTime~Miles) #calcuate the regression line for the Delta data
summary(reg.line)
abline(reg.line, col=2, lwd=2)

par(mfrow=c(1,2)) #make both plots appear together
plot(reg.line, which=1:2)  # plot residual assumption plots
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) #make only one plot appear at a time
```

## Make a change:

Make a new file in RStudio or change the name in the header of this "lab00-hello-class.Rmd" file.

## Commiting changes:

- Then Go to the Git pane (next to Environment and History) in your RStudio.

- If you created a new file, you shoud see it's name here.
- If you have made changes to your Rmd file, you should see it listed here. Click on the change to select it in this list and then click on **Diff**. This shows you the *diff*erence between the last committed state of the document and its current state that includes your changes. 
- If you're happy with these changes, write "Update author name" in the **Commit message** box and hit **Commit**.


You don't have to commit after every change, this would get quite cumbersome. You should consider committing states that are *meaningful to you* for inspection, comparison, or restoration. In the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.

## Pushing changes: 

Now that you have made an update and committed this change, it's time to push these changes to the web! Or more specifically, to your repo on GitHub. Why? So that others can see your changes. And by others, we mean the course teaching team (your repos in this course are private to you and us, only). 

In order to push your changes to GitHub, click on **Push**. This will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your PAT.

*Yay, you're done! Commit all remaining changes, use the commit message "Done with Lab 0!", and push. Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.*

*comments in RMarkdown are between stars, don't pad with spaces*

## Rubric (0 points possible)

You may not be able to do this on your own after lecture 0, so don't worry about it!!
